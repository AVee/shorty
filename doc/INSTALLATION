This package is a plugin for the ownCloud web application ("ownCloud app").
The standard installation rules apply:

Unpack the package in the "apps" subfolder of your ownCloud web root.
Enable the plugin in the "Apps" section of the configuration ("*") inside ownClouds web gui (requires admin rights).
The "Admin" section of that configuration allows to configure a base url to enable usage of the static backend (see USAGE).
The "Preferences" section of that configuration now offers two elements:
- the "Shortlet" to be dragged to the browsers bookmark panel or area (see USAGE).
- the configuration of a backend to use to generate source urls (see USAGE).
The main part of the plugin can be accessed in the left navigation menu as "Shorty".

Have fun !

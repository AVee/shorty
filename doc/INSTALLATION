This package is a plugin for the ownCloud web application ("ownCloud app").

There are two ways of installation: automatic and manual

* Automatic installation:
You need login to your ownCloud using an account with administrative rights.
Open the 'Apps' section of the adminstration and select 'shorty', enable it.
Then go on below with the basic configuration steps. 

* Manual installation:
Download the package from here: 
http://apps.owncloud.com/content/show.php/Shorty?content=150401
Create a subfolder 'shorty' in the "apps" subfolder of your ownCloud web root.
Unpack the contents of the package into the new folder 'shorty'.
Now load ownCloud in your favorite web browser and login with an administrative
account.
Enable the plugin in the "Apps" section of the configuration ("*") inside
ownClouds web gui (requires admin rights).

* Basic configuration steps for BOTH types of installation: 
The "Admin" section of the configuration allows to configure a base url to
enable usage of the static backend (see USAGE).
The "Preferences" section of that configuration now offers two elements:
- a "Shortlet" to be dragged to the browsers bookmark area (see USAGE).
- a configuration of a backend to use to generate source urls (see USAGE).
The main part of the plugin can be accessed in the navigation menu as "Shorty".

***

* Updating / Upgrading:
Up to now ownCloud does NOT bring any means to update or upgrade an installed
app. This is a major issue, since it is not even possible to update to a bug
fixed version of an app. There is nothing, app developers can do about that.

So currently, the only way to update or upgrade an installed app is to manually
adjust things:
- for a simple update (no database changes required) you have to replace the
apps files on file system level. For this you empty the apps folder at
/.../owncloud/apps/shorty and repopulate it by unpacking the new version of the
app from app.owncloud.com. You might want to adjust the files ownership and
rights. That's it, easy, _if_ you have access to the file system. Updating an
app this way keeps all data.
- if the new version of the app requires changes to the database content or
even a modified structure of the apps table(s) you have to do a full upgrade.
Most likely a fresh install of the app is the best option, though it means that
all app specific data is lost. For an upgrade you delete the apps folder
completely on file system level at /.../owncloud/apps/shorty. In addition you
have to remove those two internal settings from the base tables of ownCloud,
that mark the app as installed. Open the database with write permissions and
remove all entries from the config table that refer to the app shorty:
DELETE FROM oc_appconfig WHERE appid='shorty';
Then, remove the app specific database table, since it might have to be
recreated with another structure: DROP oc_shorty;
After this, the app will be offered for installation as if it has never been
installed. Activate it as described in doc/INSTALLATION and check the
configuration. Some settings are preserved, some not.

Sorry for the inconveniences.
However, as said, this is an ownCLoud issue.

Have fun !

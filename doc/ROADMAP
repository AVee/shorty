Future versions might implement additional features and services. Currently
planned are the following:

* Integrated proxy function as an alternative to forwarding:
Currently all browser requests are forwarded to the final target url, provided
that the referenced shorty is still valid and accessible. This is a simple but
effective strategy. Offering a transparent proxy service as an alternative
would greatly enhance the privacy protection, since the final target url of a
referenced web ressource would never be handed out. 

* Better, more fine grained access control:
Currently the only means of access control, apart from defining or remooving a
shorty are its "status". The status can block an otherwise valid shorty from
usage from outside ownCloud, it can restrict its access to authenticated users
or it can make an existing shorty freely accessible to the public. Other
ownCloud plugins allow to define individual access to content on per-user or
per-group rules.

=== Overview ===
See file README.

=== Installation ===
See file INSTALLATION.

=== Usage ===
This is only a very basic description. The plugin should be faily intuitive to
use, just have a try with a few web urls. To get going I suggest that you
- chose a backend (see configuration below).
- import the shortlet into your preferred web browser (see configuration below).
- define a few shorties either manually ("New") or by using the shortlet.
All actions on existing shorties are accessed using the action icons shown left
of the shorty in the list. Daily uses is probably based on selection the 'share'
action and grabbing the visualized "source url".
By clicking on the header row of the list of shorties you can open (and close)
a "toolbox" offering options to sort, filter and reload the list. The sorting
you chose is stored in a persistant manner, not so any filters defined. You
cannot accidentially close the toolbox when there are still filters active. 
You can remove (delete) existing shorties, but those shorties will only be
marked as deleted. This way you can 'undelete' them if required. Permanent
removal is done next time you access the shorty plugin. If you really want to
make sure the removal is done NOW then simply reload the list. This is done in
the "toolbox" of the list (click on the header row) by chosing the "reload"
icon on the left (or by a simple browser reload). 

=== PRIVACY ===
Shorty allows you to stay more in control over links you post or send. It is up
to you to decide wether a once posted link should stay valid and usable or not.
However it is also very important to keep in mind that such form of control can
never replace any serious form of access control over the content published via
a published link. Shorty works as a short url resolver, meaning it forwards any
requesting web browser to the real address of the published content. This might
change when a proxy function is integrated in a future version, as opposed to
the current forwarding mechanism. 

=== CONFIGURATION ===
There are four aspects that can be configured:
C-1.) System wide "static backend" (optional)
C-2.) Selection of a backend per user (optional)
C-3.) Import of the "shortlet" into a web browser
C-4.) Access control inside each single "shorty"

C-1.) System wide "static backend" (optional)
(Requires adminisstrative rights)
This optional setting enables a 'static backend'. That is a backend generting
source urls based on a static base url, thus the name. That base url should be
chosen as short as possible, since this defines the total length of all links
to be posted and used. Most likely the definition of that url requires the
configuration of rewrite rules on the server side. So it is only an option for
experienced adminsitrators with access to the server configuration, be it
centralized or based on decentralized per-directory rules (".htaccess files").
A basic example is packed in the .htaccess file (might be hidden in a directory
listing because of the leading dot (.) in the name). The rules must be
configured such that all requests to urls of the scheme <base url><shorty key>
are mapped directly onto the web url of the shorty plugin
(http://<domain>/<owncloud>/apps/shorty/). The <shorty key> is a string, 6-12
characters long, hard to predict. It is guaranteed to be unique thoughout the
system (though in a crude manner...). The perfect situation for the definition
of a meaningful static backend would be a domain with a very short name and
configuration access to something close to the web root.
An random example is my own domain "christian-reiner.info". Since that is not
exactly short I would love to use the additional domain "c-r.info" for the sole
purpose of a static backend. Unfortunately that domain has been reserved by a
domain grabber who asks thousands of Euros for it ! So that's no option. At
least you should try to find a setup where the web path of the owncloud
application is not part of the base url. So that you get something like
http://<domain name>/<shorty key>.
(Note that the shorty key is NOT part of the base url configuration).
You can easily test your setup any time by clicking on the example dynamically
visualized next to the configuration option. It runs a simple self-tests of the
setup in background.
There is no need that the base url must be served by the same http server that
serves the owncoud system. A static rewrite setup may well forward short source
urls to the shorty plugin inside a remote owncloud installation. 

C-2.) Selection of a backend per user (optional)
To generate the a source url that is part of every shorty the plugin uses a
backend. The configuration is done by using a preference option in the personal
preference section of the configuration. You can simply chose one of the
offered backends (combo box). 
Different backends are implemented:
C-B-1.) "-none-"
As you have guessed this is something like a "dummy" backend without any
implemented logic. That means the source urls generated are exactly based on
the web url of the shorty plugin in your owncloud system. This is not a very
clever setup, but it certainly works and keeps your data private.
C-B-2.) "static backend"
If configured in the system administration a "static backend" is offered. For a
description see C-1. This backend typically offers shorter source urls, but its
setup required administrative rights on some http server system.
C-B-xxx.) online services (url shorteners)
A few online services are offered as backends to generate short source urls.
Usage of some of those services requires you to open a free account at their
site. Detailed configuration requirements are displayed for the chosen backend. 

C-3.) Import of the "shortlet" into a web browser
Shorty comes with a neat little "Shortlet" offered in the personal preferneces
section of owncloud. It is a "button" you can import into your web browsers
bookmark toolbar or area by simple drag & drop. The Shortlet should work with
most modern browsers, though not all. Just have a try with it.

C-4.) Access control inside each single "shorty"
There are a few attributres you can configure freely inside each stored shorty:
- a title just shown inside the shorty plugin (serves recognition). 
- a notes area, maybe you want to write down whom you send the shorty ?
- a status option that controls the usage of the shorty.

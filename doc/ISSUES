This is a short list of known issues:

- The datepicker popup in the edit dialog fails to set the expiration date: 
I have no idea what the problem is. Exactly the same object works flawlessly
in the dialog to create a new Shorty. I can't see any difference, except in
the edit dialog the date is taken from the existing row entry (working fine).
Maybe there is some sort of magic spell to awake a datepicker after changing
its date value ? No idea...

- Shorty does not work in the konqueror web browser
All appears to be working fine except for one annoying thing:
the standalone dialogs won't open ! (show, create and edit entries)
Therefore Shorty is currently more or less useless in this browser.
The issue lies inside the jQuery library used throughout the OC project. 

- When internally validating the setup of the base url used in the static
backend you get a failure report ("doesn't work") although things are fine, if
the mapping of base url to shorty plugin is done by a remote server. This is
due to cross site attack prevention.
The reason is that jqueries ajax calls won't handle such redirects internally.
A wrapper will have to be implemented.

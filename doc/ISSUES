This is a short list of known issues:

* the dialog flickers in height whilst being reloaded
this is actually not suprising from a technical point of view, but it would be
great to suppress the flickerning. Unfortunately my attempts to prevent this
all break the list getting scrollable when required.

* loading subsequent chunks of clicks moves scrollbar slider
In scrollable lists of tracked clicks the position of the scrollbar slider is
moved to an odd place sometimes, when subsequent chunks of clicks are loaded
into an existing list. 

* Filtering the time column in the list of clicks appears to filter an timstamps,
not on the displayed date time. 

Contributions:
I'd be more than happy to welcome all contributions to this little experiment.
Drop me a note, an idea, a patch, a good bottle of wine, anything !

This package is a plugin for the ownCloud web application ("ownCloud app").
It offers a service to store, manage and use a collection of short links
pointing to ressources in the web. The features are a combination of a
centralized bookmarks collection, a url shortener and an access control.
The collection is presented as a link of "shorties", a shorty can be created
either manually in the list ("New") or by using the "Shortlet". The Shortlet
is something like a Booklet, a JS based bookmark meant to be stored inside the
bookmark toolbar or area of a web browser. When clicked, the page currently
open in the browser will be offered to be added to the list of existing
shorties.
Each Shorty contains a source and a target url. The source url can be used to
be posted in forums, sent inside an email message or whatever. It is typically
shorter than a full blown web url, but that also depends on the target url and
the backend used. The target url is the ressource identified by the shorty.
Basic access control is implemented, but not on a per user or per group base.
Existing shorties can blocked for usage, set to expire on a certain date and
obviously can be removed permanently again.

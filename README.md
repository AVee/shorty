shorty
======

This repository contains the main 'Shorty' owncloud app and one or more plugins to that app. 

Shorty itself is a comfortable url shortening suite with a twist. 

The plugin(s) provide additional features but are standalone apps from a technical point of view: 

shorty_tracking: tracking of requests and details to existing entries in the main app


Folder layout: 
- shorty:          the main "Shorty" app
